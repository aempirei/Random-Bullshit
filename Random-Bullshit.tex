\chapter{About}

\section{What is this about?}

This is utterly pure and random bullshit directly from my mind. Other sources are referenced as they come%
\footnote{Footnotes will primarily be used for referencing}
.  The organization of this document is probably pretty poor. The reason this document exists is to make an attempt to record my pseudo-scientific thoughts in a central place and to dissuade myself from discarding everything and to attempt to transcribe and condense handwritten paper work before it is trashed or lost.

\subsection{Current \& Future Topics}

Here is a list of current and future topics in no specific order. Further ordering may occur in a table of contents.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Fast Cellular-Automata Wave Propagation
	\item Economics of Child Birth
	\item Analysis of 1-line Algorithmic Music in C
	\item Identifying Hierarchical Structure in Unordered Sets
	\item Password Cracking as a Cover Problem
	\item Observations of SMILES and Some Ideas
	\item Reverse-Compiling with Parametric Grammars
\end{itemize}

\subsection{About Me}

I am Christopher Abad. I have worked extensively in Information Security for numerous companies since the late 90s. I have contributed to various minor projects, and have spoken at a number of insignificant hacker conferences. I was the owner of \emph{20 GOTO 10}, an art gallery which I had the pleasure of operating from 2007 until 2009, in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco. An archival site for 20 GOTO 10 can be found at {\tt http://www.twentygoto10.com/}. I can be contacted via email at {\tt aempirei@256.bz} or {\tt aempirei@gmail.com} and on AOL Instant Messenger via the screenname {\tt ambientempire}. I also have a github account and all of my public repositories can be found at {\tt https://github.com/aempirei}
